not_recommended_reason

'Sweet Magic', 'Remaily Seedless',
'Lakemont', and 'Jupiter' stand out as the
poorest performing cultivars due to susceptibility to common diseases, lower yield
('Lakemont', 'Remaily Seedless', and 'Jupiter'), and uneven ripening ('Sweet Magic').

'Jupiter' is a flavorful grape with good berry
size, but its poor cluster fill led to unattractive clusters with many shot berries

'Gratitude'
was a good cultivar with crisp texture and
mild flavor, but the brown spotting on berry
skins would make this cultivar less desirable
to consumers. 'Hope' had good yield and disease resistance but ripened very late in the
season and had an inferior quality compared
to 'Neptune', another green-fruited late-season cultivar. 'Neptune' is thus a better lateseason option for growers in this region.
