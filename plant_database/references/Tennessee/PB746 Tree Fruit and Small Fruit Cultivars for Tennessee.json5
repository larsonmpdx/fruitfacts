Malling 27 (M27)
80 to 85%
(Dwarfing)
“Superdwarf”; considered to be too dwarfing for commercial uses except with most vigorous cultivars; needs support and irrigation

Malling 9
(M9, EMLA 9)
65 to 70% (Dwarfing)
Induces early bearing, heavy production, large fruit size; resistant to collar rot, very susceptible to fireblight, susceptible to wooly apple aphid; needs support and irrigation

Budagovski 9 (Bud 9)
65 to 70% (Dwarfing)
Similar to M9 except Bud 9 is less fireblight susceptible

CG-16 60%
(Dwarfing)
Resistant to fireblight and phytophthora; very precocious and productive; does not root-sucker; susceptible to wooly apple aphids; needs support and irrigation

Very susceptible to fireblight; susceptible to wooly apple aphid and collar rot; induces early bearing; needs support; irrigation highly recommended

EMLA 7
40 to 45% (Semi-dwarfing)
Moderately resistant to collar rot; not as susceptible to fireblight as most dwarfing rootstocks; not as precocious as dwarfing rootstocks; trees need to be supported; burr knotting and root suckers can be a problem

EMLA 106
30%
Precocious, not prone to root suckering; resistant to wooly apple aphid; self-supporting; collar rot is a serious problem if planted in soils having poor drainage characteristics
