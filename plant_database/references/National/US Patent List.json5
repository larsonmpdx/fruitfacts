    author: "Jason Sutor and William Grimes, google doc", // imported and edited from this google doc which was maintained by Jason since at least 2012
    // edits:
    //   - patent links updated (many were links to applications instead of patent numbers)
    //   - expiration dates updated for most (the patent office gives extra time sometimes, google reports "adjusted expiration", so a time calculated from the application can be wrong)
    //   - fixed missing name entries and names harmonized with the rest of the database
    //   - trademarked name fixups
    //   - type fixes like "interspecific" changed to an actual type. same for plum->japanese/euro plum, etc.

    needs_help: true,
    // todo:
    // - many, maybe most, of the patent expiration times are wrong because they were calculated without extensions.  need to update time from google patents
    // - search for and add patents newer than this list. about 100/year are filed between tree fruit and berries
    // - some of the name_common fields are probably useful to massage into AKA: [] arrays
