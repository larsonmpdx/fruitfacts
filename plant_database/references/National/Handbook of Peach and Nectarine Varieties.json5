// performance in the Southeastern United States and Index of Names

// todo: +/- ripening times
// release catalogs: has a few early zaiger releases and all usda ars releases
// there should probably be different files in a folder for all of this

// the index of names has most known peach varieties at publication, maybe about 10k unique ones:
//  - 350 pages with maybe 45 per page and 30% synonyms ~= 10k
// Someday I might add that but many aren't notable so it would be mostly clutter for now
// the US patented ones ARE notable and have been added
// todo: there are probably a few OCR errors
// todo: I imported all as "peach" even though many are nectarines
// todo: the book has ripening days for many of these
